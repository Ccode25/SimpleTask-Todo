# SimpleTask: A Minimalist To-Do List App

## Description
**SimpleTask** is a full-stack to-do list application built using **React** for the front-end, **Express.js** for the back-end, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks with an intuitive, responsive interface. This project helped me enhance my skills in React, Express, and database integration while building a complete, user-friendly web app.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is mobile-friendly and adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes, thanks to **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Backend Integration**: Uses **Express.js** to handle API requests and store task data in a database (**PostgreSQL**).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, modern interface styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Others**: Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Learning Experience
This project helped me enhance my skills in **React**, **Express.js**, and **database integration**. I learned how to style a web application using **Tailwind CSS**, implement full-stack features with CRUD operations, and work with a PostgreSQL database to store and manage data efficiently.
